Developing Multithreaded Applications using Java Multithreading API and Collections API

Write a Java application that handles multiple ATM transactions (withdraw, deposit) at the same time. Create an Account class and implement both deposit and withdraw operations. Synchronize the operations to allow thread synchronization. Use Java Runnable interface to implement a Transaction class. Perform withdraw and deposit operations in run method. 

Create an AccountTest class to test multiple transactions (threads). Use an ArrayList to create a list of three or more Transaction objects. Use method execute of ExecutorService to execute the threads. Display the results.
